  <h1>Flamerock's Flash Collection</h1> 
  <p>The purpose of this site is to keep old Adobe Flash games playable without downloading software. This site uses <a href="https://ruffle.rs/">Ruffle</a> to emulate Flash it's still in early development and lots of games have issues. If you want to see a game added, add a pull request on GitHub.</p>
  <p>This site doesn't have any ads or trackers any aims to be lightweight (although it hosts flash games sooooo)</p>
  <p>If you are the copyright owners and want any of these games removed make a pull request on GitHub.</p>
  <p>So far here are the list of games:</p>
  <ul> 
    <li><a href="https://flamerock.github.io/supermario63.html">Super Mario 63</a></li> 
    <li><a href="https://flamerock.github.io/tetris.html">Tetris</a></li>
